### Use GitHub for Communicating Issues and Enhancement Requests

#### Create a new issue

If you are having trouble or find a bug in the package or documentation, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/flyaflya/causact/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, please open a new issue. 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/flyaflya/causact/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to create a pull request, also known as a PR, with a fix.

#### Submitting a Pull Request
Before submitting a Pull Request please first open an issue to get feedback on the change you intend to submit.

1. Most code should include unit tests (and sometimes e2e tests). New features should include new tests in the same PR. And changes to existing behaviour should update the relevant tests.

2. Most PR's should be linked to one or more relevant issues that they implement.

Thanks for helping!!
