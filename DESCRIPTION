Description: Accelerate Bayesian analytics workflows in 'R' through interactive modelling,
    visualization, and inference. Define probabilistic graphical models using directed
    acyclic graphs (DAGs) as a unifying language for business stakeholders, statisticians, 
    and programmers. This package relies on the sleek and elegant 'greta' package for 
    Bayesian inference. 'greta', in turn, is an interface into 'TensorFlow' from 'R'. 
    Install 'greta' using instructions available here: <https://www.causact.com/install-tensorflow-greta-and-causact.html>.
