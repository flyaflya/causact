#' Merge two non-intersecting `causact_graph` objects
#' @description
#' `r lifecycle::badge('experimental')`
#'
#' Generates a single `causact_graph` graph object that combines multiple graphs.
#' @param graph1 A causact_graph objects to be merged with
#' @param ...    As many causact_graph's as wish to be merged
#' @return a merged graph object of class `causact_graph`.  Useful for creating simple graphs and then merging them into a more complex structure.
#' @examples
#' # With `dag_merge()` we
#' # reset the node ID's and all other item ID's,
#' # bind together the rows of all given graphs, and
#' # add in nodes and edges later
#' # with other functions
#' # to connect the graph.
#' #
#' # THE GRAPHS TO BE MERGED MUST BE DISJOINT
#' # THERE CAN BE NO IDENTICAL NODES OR PLATES
#' # IN EACH GRAPH TO BE MERGED, AT THIS TIME
