#' Add edge (or edges) between nodes
#' @description
#' `r lifecycle::badge('stable')`
#'
#' With a graph object of class `causact_graph` created from `dag_create`, add an edge between nodes in the graph.  Vector recycling is used for all arguments.
#' @param graph a graph object of class `causact_graph`.
#' @param from a character vector representing the parent nodes label or description from which the edge is connected.
#' @param to the child node label or description from which the edge is connected.
#' @param type character string used to represent the DiagrammeR line type (e.g. `"solid"`).  Use `type = "extract"` to encourage causact to only pass indexed elements of the parent node to each instance of the child node.  Specify `type = "solid"` to override any automated extract behavior.
#' @return a graph object of class `dgr_graph` with additional edges created by this function.
