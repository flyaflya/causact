\title{Generate a representive sample of the posterior distribution}
\usage{
dag_greta(graph, mcmc = FALSE, meaningfulLabels = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a graph object of class \code{causact_graph} representing a complete and conistent specification of a joint distribution.}

\item{mcmc}{a logical value indicating whether to sample from the posterior distribution.  When \code{mcmc=FALSE}, the greta code is printed to the console, but not executed.  The user can cut and paste the code to another script for running line-by-line.  This option is most useful for debugging purposes. When \code{mcmc=TRUE}, the code is executed in the global environment.}

\item{meaningfulLabels}{a logical value indicating whether to replace the indexed variable names in \code{draws} with abbreviated names representing the factor value corresponding to the index.  This argument is treated as \code{TRUE} regardless of user input.  The ability to retain numerical indexing will be in a subsequent release.}
}
\value{
If \code{mcmc=TRUE}, running \code{dag_greta} populates the global envirnment with all inputs required to run statistical inference using \code{greta} and more importantly, creates three objects in the global environment that represent the posterior distribution and other information generated by HMCMC.  The three objects are:
\enumerate{
\item \code{draws}:  An mcmc.list object containing raw output from the HMCMC sampler used by \code{greta}.
\item \code{drawsDF}:  A wide data frame with all latent variables as columns and all draws as rows.  This data frame is useful for calculations based on the posterior
\item \code{tidyDrawsDF}:  A long data frame with each draw represented on one line.  This data frame is useful for plotting posterior distributions.
}
}
\description{
The input graph object should be of class \code{causact_graph} and created using \code{dag_create()}.  The specification of a completely consistent joint distribution is left to the user.  Helpful error messages are scheduled for future versions of the \code{causact} package.
