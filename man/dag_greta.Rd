\title{Generate a representative sample of the posterior distribution}
\usage{
dag_greta(graph, mcmc = TRUE, meaningfulLabels = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a graph object of class \code{causact_graph} representing a complete and conistent specification of a joint distribution.}

\item{mcmc}{a logical value indicating whether to sample from the posterior distribution.  When \code{mcmc=FALSE}, the greta code is printed to the console, but not executed.  The user can cut and paste the code to another script for running line-by-line.  This option is most useful for debugging purposes. When \code{mcmc=TRUE}, the code is executed and outputs a dataframe of posterior draws.}

\item{meaningfulLabels}{a logical value indicating whether to replace the indexed variable names in \code{draws} with abbreviated names representing the factor value corresponding to the index.  This argument is treated as \code{TRUE} regardless of user input.  The ability to retain numerical indexing will be in a subsequent release.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed onto \code{greta::mcmc()}.}
}
\value{
If \code{mcmc=TRUE}, returns a dataframe of posterior distribution samples corresponding to the input \code{causact_graph}.  Each column is a parameter and each row a draw from the posterior sample output.  If \code{mcmc=FALSE}, running \code{dag_greta} returns a character string of code that would help the user create three objects representing the posterior distribution:
\enumerate{
\item \code{draws}:  An mcmc.list object containing raw output from the HMCMC sampler used by \code{greta}.
\item \code{drawsDF}:  A wide data frame with all latent variables as columns and all draws as rows.  This data frame is useful for calculations based on the posterior
\item \code{tidyDrawsDF}:  A long data frame with each draw represented on one line.  This data frame is useful for plotting posterior distributions.

This function is currently defunct.  It has been superseded by \code{dag_numpyro()} because of tricky and sometimes unresolvable installation issues related to the greta package's use of tensorflow.  If the greta package resolves those issues, this function may return, but please use \code{dag_numpyro()} as a direct replacement.

Generate a representative sample of the posterior distribution.  The input graph object should be of class \code{causact_graph} and created using \code{dag_create()}.  The specification of a completely consistent joint distribution is left to the user.  Helpful error messages are scheduled for future versions of the \code{causact} package.
