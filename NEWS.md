# causact 0.4.1

# causact 0.4.1
* Fixed bugs introduced by changes in `tidyr::replace_na()`.
* Fixed bug related to rendering generative DAGs where two variables were both on multiple plates.

# causact 0.4.0

## Minor improvements and fixes

* Support for using `greta` matrix operations like `%*%` and other `greta` functions within the `rhs` argument of the `dag_node` function has been added.
* The readme has been updated to include a `mixture` example.

# causact 0.3.3

## Minor improvements and fixes

* Small graphs without an `rhs` argument supplied to `dag_node()` displayed a `dplyr` warning message.
* Exported `meaningfulLabels()` function for users who are using code generated by `dag_greta(mcmc=FALSE)`.

# causact 0.3.2

## Minor improvements and fixes

* `dag_render()` displayed weird DAGs when users have `dplyr (>=v1.0)` installed.  Isolated problem to changes in `dplyr::group_indices()` and `dplyr::bind_cols` that caused a jumbling of node id's.
* Updated README.md to display images and give CRAN install instructions.

# causact 0.3.1

* Initial release for CRAN
* Biggest change from previous development versions is that `dag_greta()` now returns a dataframe as opposed to creating variables in your global environment.
